## Hi there üëã

# About Me:
Agricultural Engineer with a Master‚Äôs and Ph.D. in Biotechnology, recognized with the Best Ph.D. Research in Sciences award at the Public University of Navarra. My foundation spans both experimental and computational biology, and I transitioned into computational biology by pursuing a Master‚Äôs in Bioinformatics with Systems Biology from Birkbeck and University College London. Over the course of my career, I have gained extensive research experience in prestigious institutions such as the Instituto de Agrobiotecnolog√≠a-CSIC, Francis Crick Institute, the Institute of Neurology at UCL, CEITEC in Brno, ITQB in Lisbon, and UCL, where I was honored as an Honorary Research Fellow.<br>
My work has significantly contributed to the fields of genomics, transcriptomics, personalized medicine, multi-omics data integration, RNA methylation, and systems biology. I focus on high-throughput sequencing technologies and omics data interpretation to uncover deeper insights into areas such as cell cycle regulation, bacterial infections, neurological diseases, RNA-protein interactions, and alternative splicing mechanisms. Additionally, I have developed substantial expertise in big data analysis, artificial intelligence, health data processing, and health information systems.<br>
In my teaching and mentoring roles, I have guided master‚Äôs and bachelor‚Äôs students across institutions like UCL, Birkbeck, UNAV, and UPNA, covering advanced bioinformatics, computational biology, and systems biology. I have also fostered collaborations between academia and industry through my involvement in various research projects.<br>
Since 2021, I have been leading the bioinformatics and sequencing platform at NASERTIC, within Navarra‚Äôs Personalized Medicine Department. My involvement has significantly improved the efficiency and precision of genome analysis processes, enhancing the platform‚Äôs capacity to handle genomic data from hospitals and research centers nationwide. Leading initiatives such as the IMPaCT-Data and NAGEN-Data programs, I contributed to developing a federated computing cloud, marking the first implementation of personalized medicine at a national scale in Spain. This system, which facilitates genomic data extraction and sharing through platforms like Beacon, has positioned NASERTIC at the forefront of personalized medicine and omics technologies. My work has also strengthened collaborations with Navarrabiomed, further establishing NASERTIC as a key player in advancing personalized medicine and omics research.<br>
